# Compiler

Own implementation of a compiler consisting of a lexer, a parser and a code generator. This compiler is written in Scala and designed for the WHILE language. It targets the assembler language provided by Jasmin. It lexes and parses WHILE programs, and then generates Java Byte Code instructions for the Jasmin assembler.
